# drowsiness-detection
The Drowsiness Detection System is an AI-based project designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. 
By using real-time video feed analysis, the system detects signs of drowsiness in the driver, such as prolonged eye closure, yawning, or head tilts. On detection, it triggers an alert to wake up the driver.

Features-----

Real-time Detection: Monitors driver's face in real-time using a webcam.

Facial Landmark Detection: Identifies key facial features like eyes, mouth, and head position.

Alert System: Issues an audio or visual alert when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Lightweight and Portable: Can be run on most laptops and embedded systems.


Technologies Used----

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, imutils, NumPy, and PyAudio (for alerts)

Machine Learning: Uses facial landmark detection models for feature tracking.
